== Overview

Ansible Agnostic Deployer, AKA *AAD*, AKA *AgnosticD*, is a 2 Phase deployer for building and deploying everything from basic infrastructure to fully configured running application environments running on public Cloud Providers or OpenShift clusters.

*AgnosticD* fully automates these deployments from simple basic infrastructures, aka _"a bunch of VMs"*_ through to fully configured deployemnts of complex applications, OpenShift, Ansible Tower and others.

*AgnosticD* is not an OpenShift Deployer, it is however also a deployer that just happens to be used to deploy a lot of OpenShift, amongst other things.

=== Deploy your first "Config"

There are many link:./ansible/configs[configs] you can choose from, here are two that you can start with and modify to fit your needs:

If you need a relatively simple environment, which deploys by default just a bunch of Linux hosts ready to be configureds, have a look at: link:./ansible/configs/three-tier-app/README.adoc[Three Tier App]

If a fully installed OpenShift Cluster is what you are looking for then take a look at link:./ansible/configs/ocp-workshop/README.adoc[OCP Workshop]

Another option, is deployment of software workloads on an exiting OpenShift, have look at link./link to 3scale workload.
If a fully installed OpenShift Cluster is what you are looking for then take a look at link:./ansible/configs/ocp-workshop/README.adoc[OCP Workshop]

=== How does AgnosticD Deploy

Each _config_ contains 5 playbooks, and supporting files, offering their authors hooks to enable everything from a very simple bare operating system deploy to a fully configured application deploylment.

=== Getting Started

The accompanying documentation explains how to achieve all this, extend it and add both your own environments, hereafter called _configs_ and a lot lot more.
Well designed _configs_, can be easily abstracted to allow deployment to multiple different Public and Private Clouds including AWS, Azure, and others.

* `./docs/` Start here
* `./ansible` The execution environment
* `./ansible/main.yml` The entry point for a deployment
* `./ansible/configs` Home to the _configs_ to deploy

The Contributors Guides explore the relevant structures in significantly more detail:
