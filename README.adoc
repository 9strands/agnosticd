== Overview

Ansible Agnostic Deployer, AKA AAD, AKA *AgnosticD*, is a 2 Phase deployer for building and deploying both Cloud Infrastructure *AND* and OpenShift based  deployments.

*AgnosticD* fully automates these cloud deployments from simple basic infrastructures, aka _"a bunch of Linux and Windows VMs"*_ through to fully configured deployemnts of OpenShift, Ansible Tower and others.

*AgnosticD* is not an OpenShift Deployer, It is a deploy that also deploys OpenShift (Lots of OpenShift).

=== Deploy your first "Config"

There are many configs link:./configs[configs] you can choose from, here are two
 that you can start with and modify to fit your needs:

If you need a relatively simple environment, which just a bunch of hosts, have a
 look at: link:./configs/three-tier-app/readme.adoc[]

If a fully installed OpenShift is what you are lookig for, use link:./ocp-workshop

Another option, is deployment of software workloads on an exiting OpenShift, have look at link./link to 3scale workload.






=== Getting Started

The accompanying documentation explains how to achieve all this, extend it and add both your own environments, hereafter called _configs_ and a lot lot more.
Well designed _configs_, can be easily abstracted to allow deployment to multiple different Public and Private Clouds including AWS, Azure, and others.

* `./docs/` Start here
* `./ansible` The execution environment
* `./ansible/main.yml` The entry point for a deployment
* `./ansible/configs` Home to the _configs_ to deploy

The Contributors Guides explore the relevant structures in significantly more detail:
