## Requirements

You can import roles needed for this configs by running the following:
----
cd ansible_agnostic_deployer/ansible

ansible-playbook configs/openshift-demos/requirements.manual.yml  -e ANSIBLE_REPO_PATH=$(pwd)
----

NOTE: using `ansible-galaxy install -r` is currently not possible (for now) as all roles are inside the openshift-demos-ansible repository.


Please refer to https://github.com/siamaksade/openshift-demos-ansible for documentation.
