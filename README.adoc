== Overview

Ansible Agnostic Deployer, referred to from now on as *AgnosticD*, is a 2 Phase deployer for building and deploying both Cloud Infrastructure *AND* and OpenShift based  deployments.

*AgnosticD* fully automates these cloud deployments from simple basic infrastructures, aka _"a bunch of Linux and Windows VMs in the cloud*_ through to fully configured applications for example load balancers connected to app servers connected to databases connected to...

=== Getting Started 

The accompanying documentation explains how to achieve all this, extend it and add both your own environments, hereafter called _configs_ and a lot lot more.
Well designed _configs_, can be easily abstracted to allow deployment to multiple different Public and Private Clouds including AWS, Azure, and others.

* `./docs/` Start here
* `./ansible` The execution environment
* `./ansible/main.yml` The entry point for a deployment
* `./ansible/configs` Home to the _configs_ to deploy

The Contributors Guides explore the relevant structures in significantly more detail:
